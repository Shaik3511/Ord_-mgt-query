Procedure:
==================

To complete the tasks you've described, I'll guide you through the steps. Please note that I'll provide a general outline, and you'll need to adapt it to your specific requirements.

Create the "XXBCM_ORDER_MGT" table using the script - DB_Prequisite.sql:
a. Open the "DB_Prequisite.sql" script file.
b. Review the script and ensure it contains the necessary commands to create the "XXBCM_ORDER_MGT" table.
c. Execute the script in your database environment. This will create the "XXBCM_ORDER_MGT" table.

Design the database schema:
a. Analyze the provided data and determine the entities and relationships.
b. Normalize the tables to reduce redundancy and improve data integrity.
c. Identify the necessary tables, columns, data types, and constraints based on the analysis.
d. Use appropriate naming conventions to name the tables and columns.
e. Create the tables in your database using the SQL CREATE TABLE statement, incorporating the identified columns, data types, and constraints.

Example schema:

Table: Order
Columns: order_id (primary key), customer_id (foreign key to Customer table), order_date, total_amount

Table: Customer
Columns: customer_id (primary key), customer_name, customer_address

Table: Product
Columns: product_id (primary key), product_name, price

Table: Order_Item
Columns: order_item_id (primary key), order_id (foreign key to Order table), product_id (foreign key to Product table), quantity

Develop a SQL procedure to trigger a migration process:
a. Create a database package to encapsulate the migration process logic. Let's call it "Migration_Package".
b. Define appropriate functions or procedures within the package to handle the migration steps.
c. Write a function or procedure that extracts information from the "XXBCM_ORDER_MGT" table and loads it into the appropriate tables in the new schema.
d. Use SQL statements like INSERT INTO, SELECT FROM, and possibly UPDATE to migrate the data.
e. Compile the package to ensure it is error-free.
Example package and procedure:

sql
Copy code
CREATE OR REPLACE PACKAGE Migration_Package AS
  PROCEDURE Migrate_Data;
END Migration_Package;
/

CREATE OR REPLACE PACKAGE BODY Migration_Package AS
  PROCEDURE Migrate_Data IS
  BEGIN
    -- Extract data from XXBCM_ORDER_MGT and insert into appropriate tables
    INSERT INTO Order (order_id, customer_id, order_date, total_amount)
    SELECT mgt.order_id, mgt.customer_id, mgt.order_date, mgt.total_amount
    FROM XXBCM_ORDER_MGT mgt;

    -- Continue with other necessary data migrations

    COMMIT; -- Commit the changes after successful migration
  END Migrate_Data;
END Migration_Package;
/
You can now call the Migrate_Data procedure within the Migration_Package to trigger the migration process. Adjust the procedure according to your specific data mapping and transformation requirements.

Remember to review and adapt the examples provided to match your specific needs. Also, ensure you have the necessary privileges to create database objects and execute the required SQL statements.
